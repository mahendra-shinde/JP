below line is used in Java to allocate memory (RAM) Xms = minimum mb & Xms = maximum (RAM)
java -Xms20m -Xms200m

ms		20m		20 MB		Initial RAM assigned
mx		200m	200 MB		Max Limit RAM

Instance variable gets destroyed when object is destroyed


Local Variables 	: Accessible only to parent method (Destroyed when method ends)
Instance Variables 	: Accessil=ble to entire object/instance
					  All methids in current object (Created with object [Constructor] destroyed alsong with object)
Class Variables		: Declared as STATIC
					  Accessible to ALL objects AND ALL methods in every object
					  (Created when Calss is Loaded in memory [Just before creating FIRST object])
					  (Destroyed when Class is Unloaeded from memory [Usually when JVM ends])

Both Instance variables and class vareiables are member of class.
[Declared INSIDE a class BUT OUTSIDE any method]
Both Instance variable and class variable can ne assigned Access Modifiers

Static methods are most commonly used for getting or setting values to methods

if a variable is common then it should be tagged as STATIC e.g college name is common among all the students

Switch case is used for equality checks only e.g if value 1 = Square, value 2 = rectangle, value 3 = triangle 
Switch case will search for true condition and wherever it is met it will print all the values after it finds the true condition
vs 
If Else will search for false condition 


Declare & Initalize Arrays
===========================

<DATA-TYPE> <Var-Name>[] = {VAL1, VAL2....VAL-n}
<DATA-TYPE> <Var-Name>[]; //Uninitialized Array
String names[];
int d[];
int[] data1, data2; //the reason why we can write it like this way is becuase we do not have to repeat "[]" in fornt of all the variables

Initalizing an Array
String Names[];
	names = new String[5]; //SIZE of array should be a POSITIVE NUMBER in this case it is "5".
	e.g array size (0,1,2,3,4)
	

	FOR loop e.
	for(A;B;C){
	D
	}
	A->B->D->C->B->D->C
	
	A-do{
	B
	} while(D;
	D
	A->B->
	
	PRIMITIVE & WRAPPER CLASSES
	
	Wrapper is used where primitive types cannot be used
	
	Boxing 		= Putting PRIMITIVE in WRAPPER object (Integer n = new Integer(100)); or Ineger n = Integer.valueOf(100); - this eg.will create a new integer with value 100 and assigne it to N
	Unboxing	= Extract PRIMITIVE from WRAPPER object - Here the system will firtt check if there is an intege alread creaed and then use the same
				  int k = n.intValue();	
	Autoboxing 	= Integer n = 100;
	AutoUnboxing= int k = n; //Provided n is integer object
	
	
	A & B are variables and C is a reference variables so 2 objects A & B will be created as a result of the below example and C object will not be created since it just referring variable A
	A=1
	B=2
	C=A 
	
	Implicit : when source inherits from target
		
	
	Explicit : when target iherits from source
	Source = (Source) target 
	
	Upward & Downard type casting 
	
	Difference between Immutable & Final
	Final cannot be changed
	Immutable can also not be changed but it will allow us to create a new object and update that new object so original object remains unchanged
	Primitive datatypes are all immutable
	
	String = "Mahendra"
	String Name = New ("Mahendra")
