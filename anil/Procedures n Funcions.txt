stored procedures are stored inside schema


Procedures which are not stored inside the database are called annonymus or unnamed procedure. e.g below

begin
	Update locations
	set city = 'Mumbai'
	where POSTAL_CODE = '400095';
end;


Creating a Procedure, which can be validated in Procedure section of database
create procedure update_locations AS
begin
	Update locations
	set city = 'Mumbai'
	where POSTAL_CODE = '400095';
end;

CREATE or REPLACE procedure update_locations AS
begin
	dbms



-- Below procedure is used to accept data from user and input this into table
create or replace PROCEDURE add_job_history
    ( p_emp_id          job_history.employee_id%type
    , p_start_date      job_history.start_date%type
    , p_end_date        job_history.end_date%type
    , p_job_id          job_history.job_id%type
    , p_department_id   job_history.p_department_id%type
    )
IS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO job_history (employee_id, start_date, end date, job_id, department_id)
    VALUES (P_EMP_ID, P_START_DATE, P_END_DATE, P_JOB_ID, P_DEPARTMENT_ID);
END add_job_history;


difference between
drop = delete (drop is to drop schema & delete is to delete data from table)
alter = update (alter is to alter schema & update is to update data in table)
create = insert (create is to create new schema & insert is to insert data in table)
